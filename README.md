This is a public repo for my new website.  This has been done for three main reasons:

1. My "submission" for [May1Reboot](http://www.may1reboot.com/#/)
2. My first attempt at creating a [JAMstack](jamstack.org) site
3. Learning and improvement

This will be getting updated in small steps down to (lack of) free time, but should be fun!
